# codexray RFCs

> Substantial changes to codexray (TSA) go through a Request for
> Comments (RFC) process. This directory holds them. Modeled on the sibling
> [mycelium](https://github.com/aimasteracc/mycelium) RFC process, adapted for
> TSA's Python / MCP stack.

## Why RFCs

TSA is built spec-driven and TDD-style. Before code, there is a contract. The
RFC is that contract — and, as we learned the hard way, **a spec reviewed
before implementation catches architecture-level dead-ends** (e.g. "this
design can't get a session object") that a loose `docs/*.md` would not.

## What needs an RFC

| Class of change | RFC required? |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | ❌ Issue + PR is enough |
| Internal refactor, no API/MCP impact | ❌ |
| New CLI flag / MCP action (behavior change) | 🟡 Lightweight RFC |
| Public API or MCP facade/tool addition | ✅ Yes |
| Public API / MCP surface change or removal | ✅ Yes |
| ast_cache schema change | ✅ Yes — with migration plan + schema version |
| New language plugin | ❌ Issue (follow the plugin contract) |
| Performance/SLA change | ✅ Yes |
| Cross-surface (CLI↔MCP) parity change | ✅ Yes |
| Locked design-decision change (TOON default, project_root, …) | ✅ Yes — needs explicit user approval (see CLAUDE.md) |

## Lifecycle

```
1. Draft         — copy 0000-template.md → NNNN-title.md, PR to develop
2. Discussion    — comments on the PR (Codex review included — never ignored)
3. FCP           — Final Comment Period, kicked off by a maintainer
4. Outcome       — Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn
5. Implementation — tracking issue, one PR per phase, TDD
6. Shipped       — Status → 'shipped' / 'implemented' when impl merges; flip the
                   §"Acceptance criteria" checkboxes as each lands
```

After merge, RFCs are immutable except for status updates and clarifications.
To change an accepted RFC, write a new RFC that supersedes it (note the
supersede in both).

## Status values

`draft` → `accepted` → `implemented` (or `rejected` / `withdrawn` / `superseded`).
Put the status + the PR/version that shipped it on the RFC's `Status` line.

## Numbering

Zero-padded 4 digits, monotonic. `0000` is the template. Pick the next free
number; if two RFCs collide on a number in flight, the later-merged one renames.
