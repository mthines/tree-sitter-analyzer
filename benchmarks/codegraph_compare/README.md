# CodeGraph Comparison Benchmark

Measures answer quality, token cost, and latency across three code-intelligence approaches on real open-source repositories:

| Arm | Tool(s) | Index |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `native-only` | grep + file reads | none |
| `codegraph-warm` | CodeGraph MCP | pre-built |
| `codegraph-cold` | CodeGraph MCP | built at query time |
| `tsa-warm` | codexray | pre-built |
| `tsa-cold` | codexray | built at query time |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Prepare repos (clone at pinned SHA, optionally pre-build indexes)
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py prepare --all

# 2. Run a Codex-backed smoke without spending model quota
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py phase smoke \
    --agent-backend codex \
    --dry-run

# 3. Run a real Codex-backed smoke
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py phase smoke \
    --agent-backend codex \
    --timeout-seconds 1200

# 4. Evaluate answers (LLM judge, writes EvalRecord JSONL)
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/evaluate.py \
    --runs results/runs.jsonl --out results/evals.jsonl

# 5. Print summary table
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/analyze.py \
    --runs results/runs.jsonl --evals results/evals.jsonl \
    --fail-on-gate
```

Use `--agent-backend claude` to reproduce the original Claude Code arm, or
`--agent-backend codex` to spend Codex quota through `codex exec --json`.
Run IDs include the backend name so Claude and Codex results never overwrite
each other.

Codex records include `cached_input_tokens` and `reasoning_output_tokens` when
the CLI reports them. These are stored separately because Codex reports them as
detail counters already covered by the top-level input/output totals, while
Claude reports cache counters outside `input_tokens`.

## Fairness Rules

These rules are enforced by the harness. Violating any of them invalidates a run.

1. **Pinned commits** — all repos use a fixed SHA from `repos.yaml`; no `HEAD`-tracking.
2. **Same model for all arms** — the selected model ID is applied uniformly within an agent backend.
3. **Identical question text** — each arm receives the exact same `prompt` string from `QuestionSpec`.
4. **Minimum 4 repeats** — the pilot and full phases require `--repeats 4` or higher; the summary drops any arm with fewer.
5. **Report median, not best** — `overall`, `elapsed_seconds`, and `total_tokens` are summarized as median across repeats.
6. **Cold and warm reported separately** — arms with `index_mode: cold` are never averaged with `index_mode: warm`; they form separate columns in the summary table.
7. **Index build time excluded from warm query time** — `elapsed_seconds` in a warm run begins after the index is confirmed ready.
8. **Flag low-quality answers** — any run with `EvalRecord.overall < 2.5` is marked `LOW_QUALITY` in the report even if it was token-efficient.
9. **Auto-penalize phantom citations** — citations to files that do not exist in the pinned repo reduce `citation_quality` automatically before human/LLM review.
10. **No silent drops** — timeouts and exceptions are recorded as `RunRecord` entries with `error` set; they appear in the report as `FAILED` rather than being omitted.

Claude runs use hard CLI tool allowlists. Codex runs use the same arm policy as
prompted instructions because `codex exec` currently does not expose a matching
per-tool allowlist flag. Codex native-only runs use a read-only sandbox. Codex
indexed arms use a workspace-write sandbox because CodeGraph and TSA query paths
may update SQLite WAL/cache metadata during otherwise read-only queries.

## Warm vs Cold Index

| | Warm | Cold |
|-|------|------|
| Index state at query time | Already built and on disk | Built from scratch during the timed run |
| What is measured | Query latency and quality only | Full end-to-end cost including index construction |
| Indexed build time in report | Separate `IndexStats` record | Included in `elapsed_seconds` |
| Realistic scenario | Persistent dev environment | Fresh CI checkout or first-run |

---

## Phase Execution Order

Run phases in order. Each phase gates the next.

```
smoke    →  1 repo, 1 question, 1 repeat, all arms
             Goal: verify adapters run without errors

pilot    →  1 repo, all questions, 4 repeats, all arms
             Goal: catch quality regressions before full compute spend

full-warm →  all 7 repos, all questions, 4 repeats, warm arms only
             Goal: primary quality + token comparison

cold     →  all 7 repos, all questions, 4 repeats, cold arms only
             Goal: measure index-build overhead
```

Stop and investigate if any arm has a `FAILED` rate above 5 % in smoke or pilot.
The `phase` subcommand applies these defaults directly:

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py phase smoke --agent-backend codex
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py phase pilot --agent-backend codex
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py phase full-warm --agent-backend codex
uv run python benchmarks/codegraph_compare/run.py phase cold --agent-backend codex
```

## Reading the Summary Table

```
repo         question_id          arm              med_overall  med_tokens  med_elapsed_s  fail_rate
----------   ------------------   --------------   -----------  ----------  -------------  ---------
django       call-chain-orm-001   native-only            3.2      14 200          18.4       0 %
django       call-chain-orm-001   codegraph-warm         4.1       6 100           4.2       0 %
django       call-chain-orm-001   tsa-warm               3.9       7 800           5.1       0 %
```

Column meanings:

- `med_overall` — median `EvalRecord.overall` (1–5 scale, 5 = best)
- `med_tokens` — median `RunRecord.total_tokens`
- `med_elapsed_s` — median wall-clock seconds (index build excluded for warm arms)
- `fail_rate` — percentage of repeats with `error` set or `overall < 2.5`

A result is considered **dominant** if it scores higher on `med_overall` AND lower on `med_tokens` than the next-best arm. Neither dimension alone is sufficient.
