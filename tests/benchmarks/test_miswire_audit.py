"""RED-first tests for the Mis-Wire Audit (the run-on-your-repo correctness demo).

The audit models what a name-only resolver WOULD mis-wire (bind a call to a
same-named definition in another language) and contrasts it with what TSA
actually resolves. The cross-language MOAT means TSA's count must stay ~0.
