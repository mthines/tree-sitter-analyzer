"""Guard the PyPI-visible ``pyproject.toml`` description against stale or
disproven marketing claims.

The ``[project].description`` field renders on the PyPI project page, so it is
a public credibility surface. This test pins three invariants:

1. The advertised MCP tool count matches the registry-measured value
   (``create_tool_registry``), not a stale hand-written number.
2. The withdrawn "beats CodeGraph on the benchmark median" claim — which the
   README itself retracts — never reappears.
3. The legacy ``63 MCP tools`` count (pre-facade consolidation) is gone.

If the facade count changes, update the description and this test together —
the same discipline in the split contract suites applies to the 8-facade surface.
