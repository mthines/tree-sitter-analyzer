"""RED integration test for Feature 1 (Synapse): resolve-only backfill.

The implementation of ``ASTCache.index_project(resolve_only=True)`` does
not exist yet. This test pre-populates the cache with edges that look
exactly like they did before the resolver shipped (callee_resolution=
'unknown', callee_resolved_file='', callee_symbol_id=NULL), invokes the
backfill, and asserts that:

  1. The resolution columns are populated (no edge remains 'unknown' when
     we know the answer).
  2. The tree-sitter parser is NEVER invoked. Backfill must derive its
     answer purely from ast_index, ast_symbol_rows, and ast_imports — it
     must not re-parse source. This is the whole point of the path: cheap
     re-resolution after schema/policy changes.

The parse-counter monkeypatch wraps ``codexray.ast_cache.Parser
.parse_file`` so any call site (per-instance or worker) increments it.
