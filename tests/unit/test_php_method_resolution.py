"""RFC-0010 second wave: the PHP per-language callee resolver.

PHP calls come in several syntactic shapes the resolver must classify
correctly without ever guessing:

* bare / same-file       — ``helper()`` resolves to a same-file ``function``.
* namespaced free call   — ``\\App\\helper()`` / ``App\\helper()`` resolve on the
  last segment as a same-file free function (the ``\\`` split is a namespace,
  not a class/instance receiver).
* global built-in        — ``strlen()`` / ``array_map()`` / ``json_encode()``
  classify as ``builtin`` ONLY when the project does not itself define a free
  function of that name (shadowing preserved).
* self method call       — ``$this->m()`` / ``self::m()`` / ``static::m()`` /
  ``parent::m()`` bind ``local`` ONLY when exactly ONE class in the caller file
  defines ``m`` (the enclosing class is not carried by the edge → ambiguous
  across classes stays ``unknown``).
* receiver call          — ``Foo::bar()`` (static) / ``$obj->bar()`` (instance)
  / ``App\\Util::run()`` carry a class type the edge does not record; the
  resolver must NEVER guess a same-name method elsewhere → ``unknown``.

The mandatory moat assertion: a callee whose bare name also exists as a symbol
in ANOTHER language's file must NEVER bind to that file — PHP only ever resolves
``local`` against its own (same-language) caller file, and the built-in shadow
gate is language-aware so a same-named Python symbol never suppresses (nor is
bound by) the PHP classification.
