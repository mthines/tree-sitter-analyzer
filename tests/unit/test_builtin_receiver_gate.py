"""Regression + new-design tests: inverted builtin-receiver gate.

Issue #447 (original): callee_tree bound ``result.get("format")`` (a dict.get()
call) to ``SearchCache.get`` because path 2 (_choose_candidate) lacked the
builtin-receiver guard that synapse path 1 already had.

Adversarial P1 (live-confirmed over-gating): the OLD gate fired on ANY
non-self/cls receiver whose bare method name was in STDLIB_METHODS_PY — losing
CORRECT edges for untyped receivers (``store.get()`` with unique project
DataStore.get was blocked; ``unknown > correct`` violated).

NEW DESIGN (inverted): the gate fires ONLY when the receiver is POSITIVELY
inferred as a builtin type by the extractor:
  - ``result = {}`` / ``result = dict()`` → callee_full rewritten to
    ``dict.get``; qualifier == "dict" IS in BUILTIN_TYPE_NAMES_PY → blocked.
  - ``store`` (untyped param) → qualifier == "store" NOT in BUILTIN_TYPE_NAMES_PY
    → allowed through to unique-method binding.

Tests:
1. RED (bug repro, inference-provable builtin): ``result = {}; result.get()`` in
   a file that does NOT import SearchCache → must NOT bind to SearchCache.get.
2. Counter-case: explicit SearchCache import + sc.get() → DOES bind.
3. NEW: untyped param receiver ``store.get()`` with unique DataStore.get →
   MUST bind (restores P1-regressed case).
4. NEW: self._store.get() where DataStore.get is unique → MUST bind.
5. NEW: module-level singleton CACHE.get() where CacheStore.get is unique →
   MUST bind (the CACHE singleton case is P3).
