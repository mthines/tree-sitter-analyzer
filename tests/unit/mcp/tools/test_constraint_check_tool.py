"""RED tests for ``ConstraintCheckTool`` (MCP tool ``check_constraints``).

The implementation does NOT exist yet — every test in this file is
expected to fail today with ``ImportError`` at the
``from codexray.mcp.tools.constraint_check_tool import ...``
line. This pins down the public contract that the GREEN phase must
satisfy.

What we lock in here:

* Tool name is ``check_constraints`` (must round-trip through
  ``get_tool_definition()``).
* The response payload exposes ``violations`` (a list), ``rule_count``
  (an int), and a canonical ``verdict``.
* The ``verdict`` mapping:
    - any error-severity violation → ``UNSAFE``
    - only warn-severity violations → ``CAUTION``
    - no violations → ``SAFE``
  This is the only place in the codebase that emits ``UNSAFE`` from
  the constraint layer (per spec); safe_to_edit picks it up from here.
* The optional ``path_filter`` argument narrows results by glob.

Seeding strategy: we write rows directly into
``<project>/.ast-cache/index.db``'s ``ast_constraint_violations`` table.
That table is part of the spec — if it isn't created by the
implementation we'll fail loudly when we try to write to it, which is
exactly what we want for a RED test.
