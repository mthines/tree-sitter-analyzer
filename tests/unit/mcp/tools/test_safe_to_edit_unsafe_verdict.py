"""RED tests for the safe_to_edit ↔ constraints integration (Feature 3).

The contract these tests pin down is the cross-cut: constraint violations
that were detected by ``check_constraints`` must promote
``safe_to_edit``'s verdict and surface in ``analyze_change_impact``'s
output, so the agent's first read of either tool tells them they are
about to make an architectural mistake.

Today, ``SafeToEditTool._safe_to_edit_verdict`` only maps risk_level to
``SAFE / REVIEW / CAUTION``. After this feature lands, it must:

* return ``UNSAFE`` when an error-severity violation references the file
  being edited (currently safe_to_edit never emits UNSAFE — this becomes
  the first producer);
* return ``CAUTION`` when only warn-severity violations are present;
* attach a ``constraint_violation`` entry to ``risk_factors`` so the
  agent can see the offending rule_id without a second tool call.

We deliberately keep this in its own file (per coordination rules,
``test_safe_to_edit_tool.py`` must not be modified by the test-author).
