"""RFC-0018 R10 — trace_impact must not ship a duplicate ``results`` array.

``trace_impact`` built ``"usages": usages`` and ``"results": usages`` — the
SAME list object under two keys. The array is the largest part of the
response and is re-encoded into ``toon_content`` as well, so the duplicate
doubled the dominant cost on both surfaces for zero added signal.

``usages`` is the canonical key (``usage_count`` counts it). ``results``
(the cross-tool *search* key) is dropped from trace; trace does not route
through ``search_envelope``, so nothing downstream depends on it.
