"""RFC-0018 Part 3 (safe subset) — decision-tool envelopes must not ship
*empty* agent_next_action guidance command fields.

An empty ``mcp_command:""`` / ``cli_command:""`` / ``post_edit_commands:[]``
carries zero information for an agent but costs tokens in EVERY response on
BOTH surfaces (the field is encoded into ``toon_content`` as well as the
top-level dict). The healthy-file path is the common case, so the waste is
paid on the majority of file_health calls.

These tests drive the REAL ``handle_call_tool`` boundary (NOT
``tool.execute`` — the boundary-order trap from RFC-0012) and assert the
empty command fields are absent from BOTH the JSON envelope and the TOON
``toon_content`` blob. Written RED-first: the fields are present until the
build sites stop emitting them when empty.

Scope guard (verified, do NOT broaden): only the empty placeholders are
dropped. The populated refactor action (``_build_refactor_agent_action``,
priority != "none") keeps its real commands — covered by the unchanged
``test_file_health_result_includes_direct_agent_commands_for_smells`` in
``test_file_health_tool.py``.
