"""Output-cost invariants — the missing efficiency *oracle*.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (read before editing):

The project shipped a TOON response that was ~196% the size of plain JSON for
metadata-heavy decision tools — i.e. the "token-efficient" format was almost
**twice as expensive** as the format it replaced. ~18,000 tests were green
through all of it, because every test asserted *"does the output match the
shape I expected?"* and none asserted *"is the output actually cheaper?"*. The
waste was found by a human **using** the tool, not by the suite.

Root cause: a *conformance* suite (does code match its spec?) cannot discover
that the spec itself is wasteful. The premise "TOON is 50-70% more
token-efficient than JSON" (CLAUDE.md §1) was written as prose and **never
encoded as an executable, falsifiable assertion**. So this file turns that
premise into a measured invariant. If a format claim is in a design doc, it
belongs here as a test — otherwise it is a belief, not a fact.

ASSERTION STYLE (locked exact-assertion rule, CLAUDE.md §0): absolute byte
counts here are environment-dependent (responses embed tmp paths), so exact
``==`` pins would be flaky. Per the rule's exception clause these tests assert
**documented relationships** (``toon <= json``, ``compact < default``), never
hand-waved numeric ceilings. A loose ceiling (e.g. ``ratio <= 2.5``) was
reviewed out: it passed despite the known ~1.96x bug — false confidence.

#   next_step      — narrowing hint when truncated
