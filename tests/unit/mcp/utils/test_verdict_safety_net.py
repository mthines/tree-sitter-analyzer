"""Tests for the verdict-injection safety net in apply_toon_format_to_response.

Background — pain pass 4 audit: 6 utility tools (check_code_scale,
extract_code_section, query_code, list_files, search_content,
find_and_grep) shipped without verdict and the universal helper
``apply_toon_format_to_response`` is the single bottleneck every tool
calls before returning. Injecting a default ``INFO`` here catches every
future tool that forgets to set verdict, without forcing 36 separate
patches.
