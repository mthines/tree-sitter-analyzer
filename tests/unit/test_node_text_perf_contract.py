"""Pin the ``_node_text`` perf contract: at most ONE source-encode per call.

Background
----------
On 2026-05-23 the unit suite ran in 91s instead of 29s — a 3× regression.
The hot path was ``import_extractors._node_text``, which had a leftover
``source.encode('utf-8')`` in BOTH the length check and the slice:

    if start < end <= len(source.encode('utf-8')):   # encode #1
        return source.encode('utf-8')[start:end]...  # encode #2

Each call materialized the full UTF-8 buffer of an entire source file.
Across 217k calls during one ``DependencyGraph.build()`` that was ~7.5s
of pure encoding overhead.

This test pins two invariants so the regression can't recur:

1. **Static lint** — ``_node_text`` (in any module) must not contain two
   ``.encode('utf-8')`` calls. The bug is visible at the source level.
2. **Runtime micro-bench** — ``_node_text`` must serve N calls on a small
   ASCII source in <budget ms. If a future refactor reintroduces an
   O(file_size) per-call cost, the budget will fail.

We also assert the fast path (``node.text`` bytes) is preferred — the
fallback that DOES encode is only allowed for parsers that don't expose
``.text``.
