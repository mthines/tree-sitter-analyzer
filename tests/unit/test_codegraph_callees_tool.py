"""RED tests for Feature 1 (Synapse): codegraph_callees tool surface.

The CodeGraphCalleesTool response shape today does NOT include the new
``callee_resolution`` / ``callee_resolved_file`` keys. Once the resolver
ships, every callee entry must carry them.

Harness mirrors ``tests/unit/test_callers_callees_tools.py`` so the
existing project-root + tool fixtures work the same way.
