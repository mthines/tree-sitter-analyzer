"""UTF-8 encoding regression tests for ``read_source_file`` (health scorer).

Background: ``_health_scorer_helpers.read_source_file`` previously called
``path.read_text()`` without an ``encoding`` argument. On hosts whose default
locale encoding is not UTF-8 (e.g. Windows cp1252/cp932/mbcs), decoding a
UTF-8 source file with non-ASCII bytes raised ``UnicodeDecodeError``; the
broad ``except`` swallowed it and returned ``None``, which made
``HealthScorer.score_file`` emit a false ``HealthScore(total=0.0,
dimensions={})`` (bogus grade F / ``no_data``). The fix pins UTF-8 with
``errors="replace"``.

These tests are written to be DETERMINISTIC regardless of the host's default
encoding: the regression cannot be reproduced by relying on the host locale
(a UTF-8 host would never fail pre-fix), so the locale-default failure is
simulated by monkeypatching ``Path.read_text`` to reject calls that omit an
explicit ``encoding`` — pinning the requirement that ``read_source_file``
names UTF-8 explicitly.

Traceability:
  - AC-1 / REQ-ENC-002 / REQ-ENC-005 -> test_non_ascii_file_fills_dimensions
  - AC-2 / REQ-ENC-006             -> test_ascii_only_file_score_unchanged
