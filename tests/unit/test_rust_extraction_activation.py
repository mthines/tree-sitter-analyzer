"""RFC-0010 activation: Rust call-edge extraction wired into function_extraction.

The Rust per-language resolver (languages/rust.py, #349) was dormant — no Rust
call edges were extracted, so it never ran. This wires Rust into
``_CALL_NODE_TYPES`` / ``_FUNC_DEF_TYPES`` so the resolver activates. The moat
(no cross-language binding) must hold on the now-extracted edges.
