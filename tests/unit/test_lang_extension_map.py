"""Regression suite for the single-source ext→language map.

Pins the contract introduced in commit 50e99a8f after the 2026-05-24
Alamofire benchmark surfaced that two diverged ext-to-language maps
were silently dropping Swift / Kotlin / Ruby / PHP / C# files at the
indexer boundary.

Three invariants enforced here:

1. Every language plugin under ``codexray/languages/`` that
   advertises a ``self.language`` token MUST have at least one
   extension entry in ``EXT_TO_LANG`` — otherwise the plugin can never
   be reached via the indexer.
2. The legacy ``project_graph._language_from_ext`` and
   ``ast_cache._EXT_TO_LANG`` aliases MUST resolve to the same source
   of truth (otherwise we re-introduce the historical divergence).
3. The five "long-broken" extensions stay wired: ``.swift``, ``.kt``,
   ``.rb``, ``.php``, ``.cs`` — these are the ones the benchmark
   caught.
