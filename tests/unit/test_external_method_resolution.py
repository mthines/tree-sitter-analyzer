"""RFC-0005 RED-first: external library method names classify as external, not unknown.

The cascade's new ``_try_external_method`` tier (placed after ``_try_stdlib_method``)
classifies bare method names dominated by test-framework calls (pytest, hypothesis,
unittest.mock) as ``external`` — but ONLY when the project defines no compatible-
language method of that name.

Guards:
  - shadowing: a project method of the same name wins → ``project``, not ``external``
  - ambiguous project name stays ``unknown``, not ``external``
  - cross-language JS symbol of the same name does NOT suppress classification
  - the public lazy ResolverContext(project_root=, cache=) must populate
    external_methods (the _ensure_loaded copy-back — Codex P2 bug pattern)
