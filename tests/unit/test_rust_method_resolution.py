"""RFC-0010 Rust resolver — SAFE, self-contained per-language callee resolution.

Rust call-edge extraction is not yet wired into ``function_extraction.py`` (only
python / js / ts / java / go / c / cpp appear in ``_CALL_NODE_TYPES``), so a real
``index_project`` run produces zero Rust ``calls`` edges and the resolver is never
invoked end-to-end. These tests therefore drive the resolver's CONTRACT SURFACE
directly: build the context from synthetic ``file_symbols`` / ``global_name_table``
/ ``file_languages`` maps (exactly the shapes ``_build_resolver_context_uncached``
passes) and call ``resolve_rust_callee`` — the same function the registry dispatch
in ``synapse_resolver/__init__.py`` calls.

The resolver is deliberately CONSERVATIVE (RFC-0008 lesson): it resolves
same-file / same-language local calls, classifies a tiny set of distinctively-std
associated-function paths (``Vec::new`` / ``Box::new`` / ``std::``-pathed calls),
and returns ``unknown`` for everything else. An empty tier is correct — a
mis-classification is the failure this machinery exists to prevent.
