"""Regression test for the UTF-8 byte-offset bug in ``_node_text``.

The bug: tree-sitter returns ``start_byte`` / ``end_byte`` as UTF-8 BYTE
offsets. Slicing ``source`` (a Python ``str``) with those byte values is
correct only for pure-ASCII files; the moment a file contains any
multi-byte glyph (e.g. ``≤`` = 3 bytes), every symbol indexed AFTER
that glyph gets its name shifted by N characters per multi-byte char.

We caught this in a cross-tool comparison: rg found ``HealthScorer`` in
12 files, our FTS5 index returned 8 — including missing the file that
DEFINED the class. Probing the DB showed garbage names like
``'health score'`` and ``'> HealthSc'`` instead of the real symbol names.

This test:
1. Creates a Python file that contains a multi-byte glyph BEFORE a
   class definition.
2. Indexes it via :class:`ASTCache`.
3. Asserts the class name comes back intact, not truncated.

If anyone reverts the fix in ``_node_text``, this test fails loudly.
