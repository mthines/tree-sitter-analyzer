"""RFC-0007 RED-first: qualified builtin calls (monkeypatch.setattr, obj.getattr, …)
classify as ``builtin``, not ``unknown``.

The cascade's new ``_try_builtin_method`` tier (placed AFTER ``_try_external_method``)
classifies bare Python builtin names that appear with a qualifier as ``builtin``
— but ONLY when the project defines no compatible-language method of that name.

Guards tested:
  1. monkeypatch.setattr(...)  → builtin  (the primary 688-edge gap)
  2. Project method named setattr → project (shadowing preserved)
  3. Ambiguous project method setattr (two classes) → unknown, not builtin
  4. Cross-language JS symbol of same name does NOT suppress classification
  5. Public lazy ResolverContext(project_root=, cache=) populates builtin_methods
     (the _ensure_loaded copy-back — Codex P2 bug pattern)
