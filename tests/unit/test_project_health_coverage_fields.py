"""Pin the coverage-transparency fields on ``project_health`` output.

Background
----------
Before 2026-05-23 ``project_health`` returned ``total_files`` (the
number of files actually scored) but said NOTHING about how many were
scanned, how many were skipped, or why. When an agent or user asked
"did you really scan my whole project?" the response had no answer.

The dogfood verification (docs/internal/TRUST_BUT_VERIFY_2026-05-23.md)
flagged this as the Q2 ⚠. This test pins the fix so the fields cannot
quietly disappear.

Required fields:
  - total_files_scanned   (rglob hits, pre-filter)
  - total_files_analyzed  (alias of total_files for the scored set)
  - total_files_skipped   (scanned but not scored)
  - skip_reasons          {excluded_dir: N, scoring_failed: N}
  - coverage_pct          (analyzed / scanned * 100, rounded to 0.1)
