"""Persisted "full rebuild in progress" marker (#578).

A ``--full-index --full-index-mode full`` rebuild does ``DELETE FROM ast_index``
+ ``commit`` up front, then re-populates in bounded 500-file batches (the "A4"
RSS guard in ``_commit_index_results``). Because the batched re-insert commits
incrementally over the ~70 s rebuild, a concurrent reader on another connection
(or process) sees the committed-but-empty / half-filled table and returns
``success: true`` with phantom-empty data (``caller_count: 0`` when the real
answer is 50).

The single-big-transaction "atomic swap" cannot be used here — it would revive
the exact OOM that A4's bounded-batch commit was added to prevent. So the fix is
a persisted, cross-connection marker: the rebuild stamps a single sqlite meta
row before the DELETE and clears it after re-population, and readers consult it
to warn instead of trusting the half-built table.

These tests pin the marker contract RED-first.
