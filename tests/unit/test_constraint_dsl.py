"""RED tests for the Inhibition / Constraint DSL (Feature 3).

The ``codexray.constraints`` package does NOT exist yet — every
test in this file is expected to fail today, most with ``ImportError`` on
the first ``from codexray.constraints import ...`` line. That
is intentional: this is the contract the implementer must satisfy in the
follow-up GREEN phase.

What this file pins down:

1. **Parser shape**: ``load_constraints(project_root)`` returns ``list[Constraint]``
   where each Constraint is an immutable dataclass with ``id``, ``severity``,
   ``rule``, ``from_glob``, ``to_glob``, ``reason``, ``exceptions``.
2. **Parser failure modes**:
   * Malformed YAML → ``ConstraintParseError`` with a line-number context
     in the message (so the agent can self-correct without re-reading the
     whole file).
   * Unknown top-level key → ``ConstraintParseError`` naming the key.
   * Unknown per-rule key → warn-and-skip the rule, do NOT crash. This is
     the forward-compat seam: a newer constraints.yml that uses a key the
     analyzer hasn't learned yet still loads.
3. **Glob semantics**: ``match_glob`` must handle ``**`` recursive descent
   *and* must NOT match unrelated paths that share a top-level prefix.
4. **Evaluation core**: ``evaluate(constraints, db_conn)`` streams the
   ``ast_call_edges`` table, returns ``list[Violation]``, and respects
   ``exceptions``.
5. **Performance budget**: 50k synthetic edges × 5 rules under 500 ms.
   This budget is intentional — constraint checking runs on every
   ``analyze_change_impact`` invocation, so it has to be cheap.
6. **Graceful missing config**: no constraints file → empty list, not an
   exception. A repo with no constraints.yml is a perfectly valid state.

Fixtures live at ``tests/fixtures/constraints/`` and are checked in.

        Regression test for #544: when the ``edges`` table contains two rows
        for the same call site (same caller_file, caller_line, callee_name)
        but with different ``callee_resolved_file`` values (e.g., because the
        same call was indexed twice via different resolution paths), both rows
        can match the same constraint rule and produce two ``Violation``
        objects with identical ``(rule_id, caller_file, caller_line,
        callee_name)`` — which is the PRIMARY KEY of
        ``ast_constraint_violations``.  The old code's ``executemany`` would
        then crash with ``UNIQUE constraint failed``.

        Fix: evaluate() must deduplicate on PK before returning so the persist
        path always receives at most one Violation per PK tuple.

        The test asserts that exactly 1 violation is returned (not 2) so the
        pin is tight and drift raises the test rather than silently passing
        with a loose bound.
