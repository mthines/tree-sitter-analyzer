# SMART Workflow Guide

The SMART workflow is the recommended process for analyzing code using AI assistants with CodeXray.

## What is SMART?

**SMART** is an acronym for the five-step AI-assisted code analysis workflow:

- **S** - **Set**: Set the project root directory
- **M** - **Map**: Map and locate target files
- **A** - **Analyze**: Analyze code structure
- **R** - **Retrieve**: Retrieve specific code sections
- **T** - **Trace**: Trace dependencies and relationships

## Why SMART?

Traditional approaches to AI code analysis have limitations:

| Problem | SMART Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Token limits prevent reading large files | Structured analysis before code extraction |
| AI struggles with unknown codebases | Systematic file discovery and mapping |
| Context gets lost in long conversations | Step-by-step workflow with clear checkpoints |
| Inefficient back-and-forth | Optimized tool usage sequence |

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Quick CLI Workflow Pack

If you want the workflow as a structured, copy-pasteable command pack, ask the
CLI before opening a new queue item:

```bash
uv run codexray agent-skills --format json
uv run codexray parser-readiness --format json
uv run codexray agent-workflow --format json
uv run codexray agent-workflow examples/BigService.java --format json
```

The pack includes `current_phase`, `phase_order`, `current_step`, and
`recommended_commands`. Without a target file the current phase is `set`; with a
target file it starts at `analyze`, because the agent already has a queue head
and should move straight to health, edit-risk, retrieval, and trace commands
instead of remapping the whole project. Targeted packs also include
`agent_summary.queue_ledger_command`, a scoped `change-impact` command that
separates current-queue files from out-of-scope dirty files for handoffs.

Use `agent-skills` before `agent-workflow` when the queue item may benefit from
a project-local skill. It reports each skill's trigger text, read order, support
files, scripts, context needs, side effects, completion-guidance gaps, and a
`validation` summary that separates blocking metadata gaps from caution-level
completion gaps and optional handoff polish.
MCP callers can use the matching `list_agent_skills` and `get_agent_workflow`
tools when they need the same flow without leaving the MCP surface. Use
`parser-readiness` or `advise_parser_readiness` before starting a new language
plugin so the queue begins with parser dependency, loader, plugin, fixture, and
upstream parser-risk gaps already named.

### S - Set Project (First Step)

**Purpose**: Establish the security boundary and project context.

**How to do it**:

The project root is configured at server startup. Use either:

- Environment variable: `TREE_SITTER_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/your/project`
- CLI flag: `--project-root /path/to/your/project`

**Why it matters**:
- Enables security boundary protection
- All subsequent operations are relative to this path
- Prevents accidental access to files outside the project

### M - Map Target Files

**Purpose**: Locate and identify files to analyze.

**Scenario 1: Unknown file location**

```
Find all Java files containing "BigService" in the project
```

The AI will use `search action=grep` to locate relevant files.

**Scenario 2: Known file path**

```
I want to analyze the file examples/BigService.java
```

**Scenario 3: Discover project structure**

```
List all Python files in the src directory
```

**Best practices**:
- Start broad, then narrow down
- Use file patterns when you know naming conventions
- Combine file and content search for precision

### A - Analyze Structure

**Purpose**: Understand file scale and organization before diving into code.

**Example request**:
```
Please analyze the structure of examples/BigService.java, I want to know how big this file is and what main components it contains
```

The AI will call `structure action=analyze` and return:

```json
{
  "file_path": "examples/BigService.java",
  "language": "java",
  "metrics": {
    "lines_total": 1419,
    "lines_code": 906,
    "lines_comment": 246,
    "lines_blank": 267,
    "elements": {
      "classes": 1,
      "methods": 66,
      "fields": 9,
      "imports": 8,
      "packages": 1,
      "total": 85
    },
    "complexity": {
      "total": 348,
      "average": 5.27,
      "max": 15
    }
  }
}
```

**Key insights**:
- Total line count helps estimate analysis scope
- Element counts show code organization
- Complexity metrics identify potentially problematic areas

### R - Retrieve Key Code

**Purpose**: Extract and examine specific code sections.

**Scenario 1: View structure table**

```
Please generate a detailed structure table for examples/BigService.java
```

**Scenario 2: Extract by line range**

```
Please extract lines 93-106 from examples/BigService.java
```

**Scenario 3: Query specific elements**

```
Show me all public methods in examples/BigService.java
```

**Best practices**:
- Start with structure table to identify targets
- Extract small, focused code sections
- Use queries with filters for precision

### T - Trace Dependencies

**Purpose**: Understand relationships and call chains.

**Scenario 1: Find related methods**

```
Find all methods related to authentication in examples/BigService.java
```

**Scenario 2: Locate entry points**

```
Where is the main method in this file? What does it do?
```

**Scenario 3: Track method calls**

```
Which methods call the authenticateUser method?
```

**Best practices**:
- Trace from entry points to understand flow
- Use content search to find callers
- Combine multiple searches for complete picture

## Complete Example Session

Here's a complete SMART workflow session:

### User:
```
I want to understand the large file examples/BigService.java:
1. How big is it? What main features does it contain?
2. How is the authentication feature implemented?
3. What public API methods are available?
```

### AI Response (Following SMART):

**Step 1 (Set)**: *(Assumed already set or will prompt)*

**Step 2 (Map)**: Located file at examples/BigService.java

**Step 3 (Analyze)**:
- File has 1419 lines total
- Contains 1 class with 66 methods and 9 fields
- Average complexity: 5.27

**Step 4 (Retrieve)**:
- Authentication is handled by `authenticateUser` method (lines 141-172)
- Uses session-based authentication with configurable timeouts

**Step 5 (Trace)**:
- Found 19 public methods available as API
- Authentication is called from the `main` method during initialization

## Language-Specific Examples

### Web Development (HTML/CSS)

```
I want to analyze the HTML structure of index.html:
1. What HTML elements are present?
2. What CSS rules are defined?
3. How are elements classified?
```

AI will:
1. Extract HTML elements with tag names and attributes
2. Analyze CSS selectors and properties
3. Generate classification tables (structure, media, form)

### Database Development (SQL)

```
I want to analyze the database schema in sample_database.sql:
1. What tables, views, and stored procedures are defined?
2. What are the relationships between database objects?
3. Show me the database structure in professional format.
```

AI will:
1. Extract all SQL elements (tables, views, procedures, triggers)
2. Display database-specific terminology
3. Generate professional documentation

## Best Practices

### 1. Natural Language First

Describe your needs in plain language:

```
✅ Good: "I want to understand how user authentication works in this project"
❌ Avoid: "Call analyze_code_structure on auth.py with format=full"
```

### 2. Start High, Go Deep

Begin with overview, then drill down:

```
1. "What does this project contain?"
2. "What files handle authentication?"
3. "Show me the login function"
4. "Extract the password validation logic"
```

### 3. Combine Steps When Appropriate

For simple cases, you can combine steps:

```
"Analyze src/auth.py and show me all public methods"
```

### 4. Use Checkpoints

For complex analysis, verify understanding:

```
"Before we continue, let me confirm: this file has 3 main classes - UserService, AuthService, and SessionManager. Is that correct?"
```

### 5. Optimize for Large Files

For files > 500 lines:

```
1. Always analyze structure first
2. Use table compact for overview
3. Extract specific sections, not whole file
4. Query specific elements with filters
```

## Tool Reference

| Workflow Step | Primary MCP Tool | CLI Equivalent |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Set | `TREE_SITTER_PROJECT_ROOT` env var (server startup) | `--project-root /path` |
| Map | `project action=files`, `search action=grep`, `project action=parser` | `list-files`, `find-and-grep`, `parser-readiness` |
| Analyze | `structure action=analyze`, `health action=scale`, `health action=file` | `--structure`, `--metrics-only`, `--file-health` |
| Retrieve | `structure action=read`, `search action=query` | `--partial-read`, `--query-key` |
| Trace | `search action=content`, `health action=deps`, `edit action=impact`, `edit action=safe` | `search-content`, `--dependencies`, `--change-impact`, `--safe-to-edit` |

## Troubleshooting

### "File too large to analyze"

Use incremental approach:
1. Check scale with `check_code_scale`
2. Use `--structure` for overview
3. Query specific elements instead of full analysis

### "Can't find the file"

Use discovery tools:
1. `list_files` with broad pattern
2. `find_and_grep` with content search
3. Check file extension and directory

### "Results are too verbose"

Apply optimization:
1. Use `suppress_output` with `output_file`
2. Apply filters to narrow results
3. Use `summary_only` or `total_only` options
