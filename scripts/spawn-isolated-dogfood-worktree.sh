#!/bin/bash
# scripts/spawn-isolated-dogfood-worktree.sh — create a git worktree
# pinned to feat/consolidated in a sibling directory so the dogfood
# loop can run isolated from the main checkout.
#
# Why:
#   Claude Code's harness silently resets the working tree on background
#   agent stalls. The reset is bounded to the *current* working tree —
#   a separate worktree at a different path is immune. Use this when
#   running multiple parallel dogfood loops, or when you want to keep
#   the main checkout on main / a feature branch while still iterating.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/spawn-isolated-dogfood-worktree.sh [WORKTREE_PATH]
#
# Default WORKTREE_PATH: ../codexray-dogfood
