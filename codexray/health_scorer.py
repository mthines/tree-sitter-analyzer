"""
File-level code health scoring.

Computes a 0-100 health score for source files based on weighted dimensions:
- Size (10%): Penalizes overly large files
- Complexity (25%): McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (decision-path count)
- Dependencies (20%): Number of internal project dependencies
- Coverage (10%): Test coverage from coverage.json (None if unknown)
- Duplication (10%): Repeated line-level code blocks
- Structure (15%): Nesting depth ratio vs total nodes
- Git hotspot (10%): Recent change frequency
