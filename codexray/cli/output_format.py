"""Shared output-format detection for CLI commands.

r37am (dogfood): three identical ``_wants_json`` /
``_wants_json_output`` helpers were scattered across
``cli/info_commands.py``, ``cli/special_commands.py``, and an inline
check in ``cli_main.py::_print_filter_help``. The duplication made it
easy to drift (each copy had slightly different parameter naming
``args``/``Namespace``/``Any``). This module owns the single source
of truth — every CLI command that branches on output format imports
:func:`wants_json_output` from here.
