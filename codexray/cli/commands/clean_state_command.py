"""CLI dispatcher for ``--clean-state`` / ``--clean-state-dry-run``.

Removes ephemeral workspace state that accumulates from running the CLI
(AST cache, tree-sitter cache, the literal ``:memory:`` directory some
legacy code creates, and the large test fixture directory).

Scope (#988): clean-state removes ONLY codexray's own
artifacts. It must never touch sibling tools' databases that happen to
live in the same directory — e.g. Ruflo's ``ruvector.db`` and
``agentdb.rvf*`` files. Those are owned by another tool and may hold
irreplaceable state; a user consenting to reset TSA's cache did not
consent to wiping Ruflo's memory.

Each path is handled independently so a missing one doesn't stop the
sweep. Output is one line per path: ``removed: <path>``, ``skipped (not
present): <path>``, or ``failed: <path>: <error>`` — easy to grep and
easy for tests to assert on. With ``--format json`` the sweep emits a
structured envelope instead (``success`` / ``dry_run`` / ``removed`` /
``skipped`` / ``failed``).
