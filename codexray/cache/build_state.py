"""Persisted "full rebuild in progress" marker for the AST cache (#578).

A ``--full-index --full-index-mode full`` rebuild does ``DELETE FROM ast_index``
+ ``commit`` up front, then re-populates in bounded 500-file batches (the "A4"
RSS guard in :func:`_ast_cache_helpers._commit_index_results`). Those batched
re-inserts commit incrementally over the ~70 s rebuild, so a reader on another
connection — or another process — sees the committed-but-empty / half-filled
table and returns ``success: true`` with phantom-empty data.

A single big transaction wrapping the whole rebuild would remove the window but
revive the exact OOM that A4's bounded-batch commit exists to prevent, so it is
not an option. Instead the rebuild stamps a single sqlite meta row before the
DELETE and clears it after re-population; readers consult it and warn rather
than trusting a half-built table.

The marker is persisted (visible to every connection, including other
processes) and self-expiring: a rebuild that crashes without clearing the row
leaves a marker that goes *stale* after ``ttl_seconds`` so readers are never
wedged into permanent "rebuilding" warnings.

This mirrors the ``ast_resolve_state`` single-row idiom in
:mod:`codexray._ast_cache_unresolved`.
