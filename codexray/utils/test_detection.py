"""Canonical, cross-language test-file detection and test-intent parsing.

Before this module the codebase carried ~5 independent ``_is_test_file`` /
``is_test_or_fixture_path`` / ``_is_test_path`` variants, each covering a
different subset of conventions (one matched only ``/tests/``; another missed
Go ``*_test.go``; another missed ``.spec.tsx``). The divergence meant a
concept query like ``render`` surfaced ``TestRenderJSON`` above the real
``Render`` in some tools but not others.

This module is the single source of truth, used by every symbol-ranking and
filtering path so behavior is consistent. Detection is **path-based only** —
never by symbol name — so a production class literally named ``TestRunner`` is
never misclassified as a test.
