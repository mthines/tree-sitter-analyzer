"""Bundled tsa-* skills shipped inside the wheel for PyPI / uvx installs.

Use ``codexray --install-skills [target]`` (or
``--install-skills-global``) to copy these skills into a project's
``.claude/skills/`` directory so Claude Code auto-discovers them.

Git-clone users already have the skills under ``.claude/skills/`` and
do NOT need ``--install-skills``.
