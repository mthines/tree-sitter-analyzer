"""Top-level symbol-name extraction per source file.

Sister module to :mod:`codexray.import_extractors`. Where
``import_extractors`` answers *"what does this file import?"*, this module
answers *"what top-level definitions does this file export?"* — the
second half of the data needed by
:meth:`DependencyGraph.symbol_in_degree`.

Scope (PR-0.2): Python only. Other languages return an empty set as a
graceful no-op; per-language extractors land in follow-up PRs.

Anti-scope:
* Does NOT extract methods (top-level only — class members are
  per-definition resolved elsewhere).
* Does NOT track ``__all__``, visibility, or export signal — that is
  P4's scoring concern.
* Does NOT inspect aliases, wildcard re-exports, or conditional defs.
