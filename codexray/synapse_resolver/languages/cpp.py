"""C++ resolver registration (RFC-0010 first wave).

Self-contained, conservative, SAFE per-language callee resolver for C++
(``.cpp`` / ``.cc`` / ``.h`` / ``.hpp``). It REPLACES the Python cascade for
C++ callers, so it must not regress: when unsure it returns ``unknown``.

Resolution order (mirrors the spirit of the Java cascade, far more cautious):

1. **stdlib qualifier** — a call qualified by a standard-library namespace
   (``std::sort``, ``std::make_unique``, ``std::chrono::now``) is ``stdlib``.
   ``std::`` is the canonical, near-unspoofable signal — user code never owns
   ``namespace std``.
2. **local** — no receiver / qualifier (a free function or implicit-``this``
   member call) whose simple name is defined in the caller's OWN file.
3. **project (single-global)** — exactly one same-language project-wide
   definition of an unqualified name. The single-definition gate avoids the
   ambiguity that wrecks method-name precision.
4. **stdlib / external method tiers** — consulted only when the project owns
   no compatible-language method of that name. **Both tiers are empty for the
   first PR** (see ``_cpp_constants``): C++ bare method names collide too
   heavily with user code to classify safely.
5. **unknown** — everything else (instance-receiver calls, qualified calls
   into non-stdlib namespaces, ambiguous names).

THE MOAT: a C++ callee is NEVER bound to a symbol in an incompatible-language
file. ``languages_compatible('cpp', owner_lang)`` gates every project binding,
so a Python / Java / Go symbol that merely shares a name resolves to
``unknown`` (or a same-language def), never the foreign file. C++ MAY resolve
``c`` headers (directional family compat), which is the one legitimate
cross-tag case.

KNOWN UPSTREAM DEPENDENCY (Codex PR #348 P2): the ``local`` and single-global
``project`` tiers read ``file_symbols`` / ``global_name_table``, which are
populated from the ``ast_symbol_rows`` table by the *shared* generic symbol
walker (``_ast_extraction._walk_for_symbols``). That walker records a
function-like node only when it exposes ``child_by_field_name('name')`` — but a
tree-sitter C++ ``function_definition`` exposes its identifier under
``function_declarator`` instead, so ordinary C++ free functions / methods are
currently ABSENT from those maps. Until the shared extractor recovers C++
symbols, the local / single-global tiers stay dormant on a real index and such
calls fall through to ``unknown`` (SAFE — never a mis-wire). The
maps-independent stdlib-qualifier tier and THE MOAT hold regardless; both are
covered by ``TestRealIndexIntegration`` in
``tests/unit/test_cpp_method_resolution.py``, and the dormant local tier has a
``strict`` xfail there that flips to a hard PASS the moment the extractor is
fixed (the fix lives in the shared walker, out of this module's scope).
