"""Ruby callee resolver (RFC-0010 second wave).

A self-contained, SAFE per-language resolver for ``.rb`` files. It REPLACES the
generic Python cascade for Ruby callers, so it must not regress: when unsure, it
returns ``unknown`` (never a wrong binding).

What it resolves:

* **local** — a same-file call whose simple name is defined in the caller file.
  Two distinct same-scope forms, each by a SEPARATE path:
    * a bare ``foo`` / ``foo()`` call (no receiver) → a top-level ``function``
      (module/private method) defined in the caller file, via the flat
      ``file_symbols`` scan.
    * ``self.foo`` — a method call on the caller's own object. Bound ONLY through
      the unambiguous single-class gate (``file_class_methods`` with exactly one
      class), so ``self.render`` never binds to a sibling class's ``render``.
* **project** — a bare name with exactly ONE project-wide definition that lives
  in a Ruby file, AND that definition is a bare-callable kind (a top-level
  ``function``). The single-global rule, gated by language so a same-named
  Python/Java symbol is never bound.
* **builtin** — a namespaced Ruby core call (``Math.sqrt`` …) matched on the
  FULL dotted call name. Terminal — outside the project, never re-scanned.
  Suppressed when the project itself owns the receiver name in a Ruby file.
* **unknown** — everything else (the conservative default).

THE MOAT — this resolver NEVER binds a callee to a symbol in a non-Ruby file.
Cross-language same-name collisions resolve to ``unknown`` (or the Ruby
same-file definition), never to the foreign file. That is the exact CodeGraph
failure this project exists to beat.

Ruby vs JavaScript note: in Ruby ``self`` IS the current object (so ``self.foo``
is the canonical same-object method call, handled like Java's ``this``). Ruby
has no ``this`` keyword. ``require`` / ``require_relative`` load *files*, not
named symbols, so there is no symbol-level import tier — method resolution is
purely local / single-global / namespaced-core, which is why this resolver is
shaped on the JavaScript resolver rather than the import-driven Java one.
