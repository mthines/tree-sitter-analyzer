r"""PHP callee resolver (RFC-0010, second wave).

Self-contained and SAFE. It REPLACES the Python cascade for PHP callers
(``file_languages == "php"``) without regressing: it resolves SAME-FILE/
SAME-LANGUAGE local calls, classifies a curated set of global built-in free
functions as ``builtin``, and returns ``unknown`` for everything else.

PHP call shapes and how each is handled:

* **bare ``foo()``** (no receiver) — a free-function call. Resolved ``local`` to
  a same-file ``function``/``class`` definition first; else, if ``foo`` is a
  curated global built-in NOT shadowed by a project free function, ``builtin``;
  else ``unknown``. A namespaced free call (``\App\foo`` / ``App\foo``) is
  treated as bare on its LAST segment.
* **``$this->m()`` / ``self::m()`` / ``static::m()`` / ``parent::m()``** — a
  method call on the current object/class. Bound ``local`` ONLY when exactly one
  class in the caller file defines ``m`` (the caller's enclosing class is not
  carried by the edge, so an ambiguous name across two classes stays
  ``unknown`` — never the file-wide first match, the wave-1 Codex P2 lesson).
* **``Foo::m()`` (static) / ``$obj->m()`` (instance)** — a receiver call whose
  class type the edge does not carry. Never guessed → ``unknown``.

THE MOAT — never cross-language bind. The resolver only ever consults the
CALLER file's own ``file_symbols`` / ``file_class_methods`` for a ``local``
match and never looks up a symbol in another file, so a same-named symbol in a
different language's file can never be bound. Built-in classification produces
no symbol/file at all. PHP has no interop family (``languages_compatible`` is
True only for the identical tag), so even the ownership/shadow gate is
same-language by construction.

Conservative tiers only (the RFC-0008 lesson): the bare built-in set is a small
hand-audited list of global functions a project almost never shadows; the
external tier is EMPTY. Receiver-qualified method names stay ``unknown``.

Contract (RFC-0010): the module ends with
``register_language("php", build_php_context, resolve_php_callee)``.
