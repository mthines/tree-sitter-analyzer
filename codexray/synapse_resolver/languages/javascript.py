"""JavaScript callee resolver (RFC-0010 first wave).

A self-contained, SAFE per-language resolver for ``.js`` / ``.jsx`` files. It
REPLACES the generic Python cascade for JavaScript callers, so it must not
regress: when unsure, it returns ``unknown`` (never a wrong binding).

What it resolves:

* **local** — a same-file call (no receiver, or ``this.``) whose simple name is
  defined in the caller file (function / method / class). Pulled from the
  shared ``file_symbols`` / ``file_class_methods`` maps.
* **project** — a bare name with exactly ONE project-wide definition that lives
  in a JS-family file (``.js``/``.ts``/``.jsx``/``.tsx``). The single-global
  rule, gated by language so a same-named Python/Java symbol is never bound.
* **builtin** — a namespaced JS global call (``JSON.parse``, ``Object.keys``,
  ``Math.max`` …) matched on the FULL dotted call name. Terminal — outside the
  project, never re-scanned.
* **unknown** — everything else (the conservative default).

THE MOAT — this resolver NEVER binds a callee to a symbol in a non-JS-family
file. Cross-language same-name collisions resolve to ``unknown`` (or the JS
same-file definition), never to the foreign file. That is the exact CodeGraph
failure this project exists to beat.

#: Same-scope receivers handled by the ``local`` tier, each by a DISTINCT path
#: (see ``resolve_javascript_callee`` step 1):
#:   * ``""``   — a bare ``foo()`` call: a top-level callable in the caller file.
#:   * ``this`` — a method call on the caller's own object, bound only through
#:     the unambiguous single-class gate.
#: ``self`` is DELIBERATELY ABSENT — in browser/worker JavaScript ``self`` is the
#: global scope (``Window.self`` / ``WorkerGlobalScope.self``), not the current
#: object. Treating ``self.foo()`` as a same-file call would bind it to any local
#: helper named ``foo`` — a concrete wrong edge (Codex P2 #346).

#: JS-family dialects this resolver claims. ``.jsx`` files are tagged ``"jsx"``
#: by the language detector and ``resolve_callee`` dispatches by that exact
#: string, so the resolver registers under every JS-family dialect it serves —
#: otherwise JSX callers bypass this SAFE resolver and leak into the Python
#: cascade (e.g. a bare ``len()`` mis-classified as a Python builtin). TS/TSX
#: have their own resolvers; this module owns ``javascript`` and ``jsx`` only
