"""Kotlin callee resolver (RFC-0010, second wave).

Self-contained and SAFE — it REPLACES the Python cascade for Kotlin callers
(``file_languages == "kotlin"``; ``.kt`` / ``.kts`` files), so it must never
regress: when unsure it returns ``unknown``. Its jobs are:

1. **local (bare call)** — a receiver-less call (``helper()``) to a top-level
   function / class defined in the CALLER's OWN file. Same file == same language
   by construction, so this can never cross-bind.
2. **local (``this``/``super`` member call)** — a ``this.helper()`` /
   ``super.helper()`` call binds a same-file ``method`` row ONLY when exactly one
   method of that name exists in the file (the owner-class map disambiguates). An
   ambiguous name (two classes in the file define it) stays ``unknown`` — the
   resolver carries no caller-owner class (Codex P2 wave-1 lesson). A receiver
   call NEVER binds a top-level function.
3. **stdlib** — a bare (receiver-less) call to one of a tiny set of
   AUTO-IMPORTED Kotlin stdlib top-level functions (``listOf`` / ``println`` /
   ``require`` …), gated on the project NOT owning that name in a
   compatible-language file (shadowing preserved). See ``_kotlin_constants``.
4. **unknown** — everything else: receiver method calls on a variable
   (``items.map`` — the receiver type the edge does not carry), cross-file
   project calls, qualified third-party calls, ambiguous names.

THE MOAT (the #1 correctness requirement): a Kotlin callee is NEVER bound to a
symbol in a different language's file. The ``local`` tiers only ever consult the
caller's OWN file; the stdlib-ownership gate is language-aware via
``languages_compatible``. Critically, Kotlin and Java are NOT one
``languages_compatible`` family, so even on the JVM a Kotlin caller never binds a
Java symbol (and a Java ``listOf`` never suppresses Kotlin's stdlib tier). Real
Kotlin/Java interop would need import/type evidence this resolver does not carry;
modelling it would risk the exact cross-language mis-wire this machinery exists
to beat, so it is deliberately out of scope — ``unknown`` is the safe answer.

NOTE: Kotlin call-edge extraction is not yet enabled in
``function_extraction._CALL_NODE_TYPES`` (python/js/ts/java/go/c/cpp only), so a
real index produces no Kotlin ``calls`` edges and this resolver is dormant
end-to-end until that (separate, out-of-scope) extractor change lands. The
resolver is correct and tested at its contract surface now, so it activates with
zero further work the moment Kotlin edges are produced.

Contract (RFC-0010): the module ends with
``register_language("kotlin", build_kotlin_resolver_context,
resolve_kotlin_callee)``.
