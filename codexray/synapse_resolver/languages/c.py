"""C resolver registration (RFC-0010 second wave).

Self-contained, conservative, SAFE per-language callee resolver for C
(``.c`` / ``.h``). It REPLACES the Python cascade for C callers, so it must not
regress: when unsure it returns ``unknown``.

C is structurally SIMPLER than C++ — and that simplicity shapes the cascade:

* **No namespace qualifier tier.** C has no ``std::`` analogue, so there is no
  unspoofable namespace signal. The only classified tier is a conservative
  libc free-function name set (``_c_constants``), gated on project ownership.
* **No member-method dispatch.** C has no classes/methods; a ``a->b`` or ``a.b``
  call is a struct-field / function-pointer access on a *value*, whose target
  type the resolver cannot prove. Any such qualified call stays ``unknown``.

Resolution order (most-specific first):

1. **local** — an UNQUALIFIED call whose simple name is a free function defined
   in the caller's OWN file.
2. **project (single-global)** — exactly one same-language project-wide
   definition of an unqualified name. The single-definition gate avoids the
   ambiguity that wrecks name precision.
3. **libc** — an unqualified name in the conservative libc set, but ONLY when
   the project owns no compatible-language function of that name (project
   shadowing wins; classified ``stdlib``).
4. **unknown** — everything else (struct-field / function-pointer calls through
   a receiver, and unqualified names with no local / single-global / libc hit,
   or an ambiguous multi-global name).

THE MOAT: a C callee is NEVER bound to a symbol in an incompatible-language
file. ``languages_compatible('c', owner_lang)`` gates every project binding.
For C this gate is DIRECTIONAL and asymmetric (see ``_language_family``): a C
caller resolves only ``c`` (including ``.h`` headers, indexed as ``c``) — it
must NOT bind a ``cpp`` / ``objc`` / Python / Go definition that merely shares a
name (``languages_compatible('c', 'cpp')`` is False; the C++ side of the
relation is one-directional). A foreign same-name symbol stays ``unknown``.

SYMBOL SOURCE (shared with the C++ resolver): the ``local`` and single-global
``project`` tiers — and the libc tier's project-ownership gate
(``_project_owns``) — read ``file_symbols`` / ``global_name_table``, populated
from ``ast_symbol_rows`` by the shared generic symbol walker
(``_ast_extraction._walk_for_symbols``). A tree-sitter C ``function_definition``
exposes its identifier under ``function_declarator`` (no ``name`` field), so the
walker recovers it explicitly via ``_c_function_def_name``; ordinary C free
functions therefore DO reach those maps on a real index. This matters for
correctness, not just the dormant local tier: a project that defines its OWN
``malloc`` (a custom allocator) now appears in ``global_name_table``, so
``_project_owns`` shadows the libc tier and the call resolves to the project
definition instead of being misclassified ``stdlib`` (Codex P2, PR #353). THE
MOAT still language-gates every project binding, so a same-name symbol in a
non-C file is never bound. All of this is covered by ``TestRealIndexIntegration``
in ``tests/unit/test_c_method_resolution.py``.
