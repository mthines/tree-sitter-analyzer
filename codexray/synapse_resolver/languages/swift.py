"""Swift resolver registration (RFC-0010).

A SAFE, self-contained per-language callee resolver for Swift. It:

* resolves SAME-FILE / SAME-LANGUAGE local calls from ``file_symbols`` (bare
  free-function calls and ``self.method`` / ``Self.method`` calls), and
* classifies a tiny, CONSERVATIVE std tier — a curated set of near-exclusive
  Swift global functions (``print``, ``assert``, ``fatalError``, …) — as
  ``stdlib``, and
* returns ``unknown`` for everything else.

THE MOAT (the #1 correctness requirement): this resolver NEVER binds a Swift
callee to a symbol in a different language's file. This is the exact failure
mode that makes a name-only indexer wire Python ``sorted()`` to a Swift
``func sorted`` — here, every binding is gated by ``languages_compatible`` and
local resolution only ever consults the caller's OWN file. A same-name symbol in
another language (or another Swift file, absent type evidence) is left
``unknown``, never wired across.
