"""C# resolver registration (RFC-0010, second wave).

Self-contained, conservative, SAFE per-language callee resolver for C#
(``.cs``). It REPLACES the Python cascade for C# callers, so it must not
regress: when unsure it returns ``unknown``.

Resolution order (mirrors the spirit of the C++ resolver, equally cautious):

1. **System.* qualifier** — a call qualified by the fully-qualified BCL root
   namespace (``System.Console.WriteLine``, ``System.Linq.Enumerable.Select``)
   is ``stdlib``. ``System.`` is the canonical, near-unspoofable signal — user
   code never owns ``namespace System``. This wins first and needs no shadow
   gate.
2. **local** — no receiver (a bare method/function call) or an explicit
   ``this``/``base`` receiver whose simple name is defined in the caller's OWN
   file. A ``this``/``base`` member call binds only when exactly ONE class in
   the file owns that method name (else the caller's class is unprovable →
   unknown).
3. **project (single-global)** — exactly one same-language project-wide
   definition of an UNQUALIFIED name. The single-definition gate avoids the
   ambiguity that wrecks method-name precision. Excluded for ``this``/``base``
   member calls (a member call can never reach a cross-file global).
4. **BCL static-type qualifier tier** — a bare static-type-qualified call
   (``Console.WriteLine``, ``Math.Max``, ``String.Format``) is ``stdlib`` ONLY
   when the project does not itself define a compatible-language symbol of that
   type name (shadowing preserved). See ``_csharp_constants``.
5. **stdlib / external METHOD tiers** — consulted only when the project owns no
   compatible-language symbol of that name. **Both are EMPTY for this PR** (C#
   bare method names collide too heavily with user code to classify safely).
6. **unknown** — everything else (instance-receiver calls, qualified calls into
   non-System / non-BCL types, ambiguous names).

THE MOAT (never cross-language bind): every project binding is gated by
``languages_compatible('csharp', owner_lang)``. C# is its own family (no
directional/symmetric compat with any other tag), so a Python / Java / Go
symbol that merely shares a name resolves to ``unknown`` (or a same-language
def), NEVER the foreign file. The ``System.*`` and BCL tiers resolve to
``stdlib`` only — never to a project file.

The cascade returns a plain ``(symbol_id, resolution, resolved_file)`` tuple;
the package ``__init__`` wraps it into a ``ResolvedCallee``.
