"""Rust resolver registration (RFC-0010).

A SAFE, self-contained per-language callee resolver for Rust. It:

* resolves SAME-FILE / SAME-LANGUAGE local calls from ``file_symbols``
  (bare free-fn calls and ``self.method`` / ``Self::method`` calls), and
* classifies a tiny, CONSERVATIVE std tier — ``std::``/``core::``/``alloc::``-
  pathed calls and a curated ``StdContainer::ctor`` set (``Vec::new``,
  ``Box::new``, …) — as ``stdlib``, and
* returns ``unknown`` for everything else.

THE MOAT (the #1 correctness requirement): this resolver NEVER binds a Rust
callee to a symbol in a different language's file. Local resolution only ever
consults the caller's OWN file; the single-global step is intentionally NOT
implemented because a same-name symbol in another Rust file (let alone another
language) is not safe to bind without receiver-type evidence. The std-ownership
gate is language-aware via ``languages_compatible`` so a Python ``swap`` never
suppresses Rust's std tier and is never bound.

NOTE: Rust call-edge extraction is not yet enabled in
``function_extraction._CALL_NODE_TYPES`` (python/js/ts/java/go/c/cpp only), so a
real index produces no Rust ``calls`` edges and this resolver is dormant
end-to-end until that (separate, out-of-scope) extractor change lands. The
resolver is correct and tested at its contract surface now, so it activates with
zero further work the moment Rust edges are produced.

    call carries no caller-owner type, so the resolver cannot tell which impl block's
    ``helper`` the receiver refers to. When two impls in the same file both define
    ``helper`` (``impl A { fn helper }`` + ``impl B { fn helper }``), binding to

    mis-bind to an unrelated free function, the exact corruption Codex flagged.
