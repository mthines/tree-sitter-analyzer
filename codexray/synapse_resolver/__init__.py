"""
Feature 1 (Synapse) — Index-time cross-file callee resolution.

Public API:
    ``ResolverContext``     — project-wide indices, built once per pass.
    ``ResolvedCallee``      — output of one resolution.
    ``resolve_callee``      — one callee → ResolvedCallee, per priority cascade.
    ``parse_imports``       — import-statement text -> structured rows.
    ``build_resolver_context`` — populate a ResolverContext from the cache.
    ``is_enabled``          — honour the ``TSA_SYNAPSE`` env var.
    ``BUILTINS_PY``         — Python builtin callable names.
    ``STDLIB_NAMES_PY``     — Python stdlib top-level module names.

Priority cascade implemented by ``resolve_callee``:
  1. local      – same-file function/method match.
  2. self/cls   – ``self.X`` or ``cls.X`` on the same class.
  3. import     – name imported via ``from M import X``, or module alias
                  qualifier (``bb.baz`` after ``from . import b as bb``).
  4. stdlib     – allowlist of stdlib modules / builtins.
  5. single     – exactly one project-wide definition with that name.
  6. unknown    – nothing matched.

Star imports get an ``ast_imports`` row with ``is_star=1`` but the
resolver does NOT promote star-imported names to ``project`` in 3a.
