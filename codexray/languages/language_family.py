"""Language-family equivalence + lightweight path→language for resolution gates.

The cross-language callee gates (synapse resolver, unresolved-ref candidate
scoring, the global bare-name fallback, and the nav body inliner) must block a
*known* language mismatch (Python → JavaScript/Swift) without rejecting
legitimate same-family resolution. JavaScript and TypeScript are one interop
family — gradual-migration projects freely cross-import ``.js``/``.ts``/
``.jsx``/``.tsx`` — and ``CrossFileResolver._register_module_path`` already
treats them as one import family, so the gates do too (Codex P2 #301).

For C/C++/Objective-C, compatibility is **directional**: a C++ or Objective-C++
caller may resolve symbols defined in C headers (indexed as ``c``), because
``.h`` files are typically indexed as ``c`` even when included from ``.cpp``
translation units. The reverse — a pure-C caller resolving a ``.cpp`` function
— is a foreign binding and should remain blocked (Codex P2 #302).
