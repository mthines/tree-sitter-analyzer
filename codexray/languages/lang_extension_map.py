"""Single source of truth for file-extension → language mapping.

History
-------
Before 2026-05-24 this lived in TWO places:

* ``codexray/ast_cache.py::_EXT_TO_LANG``
* ``codexray/project_graph.py::_language_from_ext``

Those two maps drifted. ``project_graph`` omitted Swift / Kotlin / Ruby /
PHP / C# while ``ast_cache`` had them. Since ``ast_cache.index_file``
calls ``project_graph._language_from_ext``, the smaller map won and
five fully-wired language plugins silently rejected every file with
``status: skipped, reason: unsupported language``. The Alamofire
benchmark surfaced it: TSA indexed 10 / 98 files (and the 10 were JS
files from the docs/ folder). See commit 50e99a8f.

This module is now the ONLY place where the mapping lives. Both
``ast_cache`` and ``project_graph`` import from here.

Adding a new language
---------------------
1. Make sure ``codexray/languages/<lang>_plugin.py`` (or
   the ``<lang>_plugin/`` package) exists AND its constructor sets
   ``self.language = "<lang>"`` to a key the plugin registry recognises.
2. (Optional) Add ``codexray/queries/<lang>.py`` if symbol
   extraction needs custom queries beyond what the extractor handles.
3. Add the extension(s) here.
4. ``tests/unit/test_lang_extension_map.py`` enforces that every plugin
   listed in ``codexray/languages/`` has at least one entry
   here. Add the test fixture entry if necessary.
