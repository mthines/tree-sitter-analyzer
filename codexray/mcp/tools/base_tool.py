        Normalization rules — minimal and reversible:
        - Convert backslash separators to forward slash (Windows compat).

        PL-C: the MCP spec recommends every tool declare an
        ``outputSchema`` so clients can validate the response shape and
        decide whether to render it as a structured data table vs. plain
        text. Currently 0/55 tools declare one — adding the canonical
        envelope here means every subclass inherits the contract for
        free, and tool-specific subclasses can override (or extend the
        ``properties`` map) for richer payload schemas.

        The shape mirrors what :func:`mirror_summary_line` and
        :func:`_canonicalize_verdict` already enforce at runtime: every
        successful response carries ``success`` + ``verdict`` at the top
        level, plus an ``agent_summary`` sub-object with the same
        ``verdict`` mirror plus a one-line ``summary_line`` and a
        ``next_step`` hint. ``additionalProperties=True`` is deliberate —
        each tool layers its own payload (e.g. ``classes``, ``methods``,
        ``call_graph``) on top, and a strict schema would force every
        sweep to update the base. The required-fields set stays minimal
        (``success`` + ``verdict``) so validators don't reject otherwise
        well-formed responses that happen to omit optional summary
        fields.
