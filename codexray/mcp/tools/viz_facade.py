"""``viz`` facade — Wave B facade for the FacadeTool framework (P0 geode layer).

Folds 3 visualization capabilities behind one ``action`` parameter, split
from the ``health`` facade (which had 14 actions — the uml/graph/similarity
trio was flagged as a split candidate per PRD §3).

==========  ====================================  =============================================
action      inner / route                         engine / purpose
==========  ====================================  =============================================
uml         ``codegraph_uml`` (CodeGraphUMLTool)  UML class/sequence diagrams
graph       ``codegraph_visualize``               call/dependency graph visualizations
similarity  ``codegraph_similarity``              duplicate / near-duplicate code detection
knowledge   ``codegraph_knowledge_graph``         code/doc knowledge graph export
==========  ====================================  =============================================

Annotation honesty: every action in this facade is read-only (pure generation
/ analysis, no mutations), so ``readOnlyHint=True`` is valid.
