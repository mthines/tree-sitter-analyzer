    H3 fix: ``DependencyGraph.find_cycles`` does a DFS that iterates

    Set iteration order in CPython depends on ``PYTHONHASHSEED``, so
    different OS-level invocations of the same code on the same project
    produced different enumeration trees and thus a *different number*
    of cycles — the dogfood agent saw ``cycle_count`` flicker 5↔6 across

    We re-implement the DFS here with sorted iteration of nodes and
    neighbours. The algorithm matches ``DependencyGraph.find_cycles``
    (back-edge style cycle detection) so the result shape and semantics
    are unchanged; only the enumeration order is now stable. Cycles are
    additionally canonicalised (rotated to start at their lexicographically

    - blast_radius: <file> forward=N reverse=N

    N3 (round-29 dogfood): every mode also emits ``verdict`` on the
    success path. ``dependency_analysis`` is informational — most modes
    default to ``INFO``. The exceptions are signalling-mode escalations:
    - ``summary`` / ``cycles`` with ``cycle_count > 0`` → ``WARN``
      (cycles flag a real refactor hazard the agent should surface).
    - ``blast_radius`` with > 50 forward-impact files → ``REVIEW``
      (large blast radius warrants explicit caller acknowledgment).
    The vocabulary is the same set used by other envelope-contract
    tools (see ``_N_VERDICT_VOCABULARY`` in the contract tests).
