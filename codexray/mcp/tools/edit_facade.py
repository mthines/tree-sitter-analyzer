"""``edit`` facade — Wave B facade for edit/safety/impact capabilities.

Folds eight code-safety and change-management capabilities behind one
``action`` parameter:

============  ==============================  ================================
action        inner tool                      when to use
============  ==============================  ================================
safe          ``safe_to_edit``                Pre-edit safety gate (SAFE/UNSAFE)
guard         ``modification_guard``          Blast-radius guard before touching a symbol
impact        ``analyze_change_impact``       Post-edit dependency blast-radius scan
refactor      ``refactoring_suggestions``     Refactoring opportunities for a file
constraints   ``check_constraints``           Constraint violations in the project
pr            ``codegraph_pr_review``         AI review of a PR diff via CodeGraph
classify      ``semantic_classify``           Semantic change classification (file git-diff or code strings)
ast_diff      ``ast_diff``                    Structural diff of two AST snapshots
============  ==============================  ================================

Annotation honesty (spec §6 / review §8 F-extra-3):
    This facade spans READ-ONLY actions (``safe``, ``impact``, ``classify``,
    ``constraints``, ``pr``, ``ast_diff``) and MUTATING-INTENT actions
    (``refactor`` suggests changes; ``guard`` checks before a write). A single
    honest ``readOnlyHint=True`` is IMPOSSIBLE for this facade — doing so would
    violate the ``test_every_tool_declares_mcp_annotations`` contract which
    forbids ``readOnly AND destructive``. We therefore set
    ``readOnlyHint=False, destructiveHint=False`` (it suggests / analyses,
    does not actually write files), ``idempotentHint=False`` (analysis results
    may differ as the index updates), ``openWorldHint=False``. Read actions lose
    the read-safe signal — accepted tradeoff per PRD §4. If a strict read-only
    sub-facade is later needed, split ``safe``/``impact``/``classify`` into a
    separate read-only facade (out of scope for Wave B).

Not registered in ``_tool_registry.py`` at P0; Wave C handles cutover.

    "constraint checks, semantic classification, and AST diff in one tool. "
    "Pick a capability via `action`:\n"
    "- action=safe — pre-edit safety gate: is this file safe to edit right now? "
    "Returns SAFE/UNSAFE verdict. Params: file_path, edit_type, output_format.\n"
    "- action=guard — blast-radius guard BEFORE touching a symbol: how many callers, "
    "what test coverage, what risk level. "
    "Params: symbol* (required), modification_type* (required), file_path.\n"
    "- action=impact — post-edit dependency blast-radius scan combining git diff + "
    "dependency graph: affected files, must-run tests, risk verdict (SAFE/REVIEW/WARN). "
    "Call after every non-trivial edit. Params: mode (diff|staged|branch|pr, "
    "default: diff), scope_paths, output_format.\n"
    "- action=refactor — refactoring-opportunity analysis for a source file: extract "
    "candidates, complexity hotspots, skeleton. Params: file_path, language, "
    "max_suggestions, include_extractions, include_skeleton, output_format.\n"
    "- action=constraints — scan the project for constraint/rule violations "
    "(architecture, naming, coupling). Params: severity_min, output_format.\n"
    "- action=pr — AI review of a PR diff via codegraph: structural issues, "
    "blast-radius, test-coverage gaps (codegraph_pr_review equivalent). "
    "Params: pr_url or diff (see inner schema).\n"
    "- action=classify — semantic change classification: classify a file's diff "
    "between git refs (file_path [+ old_ref/new_ref]) or two code strings "
    "(old_source + new_source + language). With only file_path, defaults to the "
    "file/git-ref mode. Params: file_path | old_source+new_source+language, "
    "output_format.\n"
    "- action=ast_diff — structural AST diff between two snapshots/versions of "
    "a file: added/removed/changed nodes. Mode is inferred from args when omitted. "
    "Modes: diff_files (old_file + new_file), "
    "diff_strings (old_source + new_source + language), "
