Trace Impact Tool

Lightweight impact analysis tool that finds all call sites of a symbol (method/class/function)
using ripgrep. Unlike full call graph solutions, this provides fast "usage tracing" without
requiring a graph database.

This tool is inspired by GitNexus's impact analysis but optimized for codexray's
architecture, reusing existing ripgrep infrastructure.
