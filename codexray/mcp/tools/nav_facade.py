"""``nav`` facade — Wave B consolidation of code-navigation inner tools.

Folds eight navigation capabilities (plus two scope-discriminated actions)
behind one ``action`` parameter:

============  =============================================  ==========================
action        inner / route                                  scope/notes
============  =============================================  ==========================
navigate      ``codegraph_navigate``                         symbol go-to-definition
call_path     ``codegraph_call_path``                        BFS path between functions
xref          ``codegraph_xref``                             cross-reference lookup
resolve       ``codegraph_resolve``                          symbol resolver
lineage       ``symbol_lineage``                             class/function lineage
impact        ``codegraph_impact``                           blast-radius / risk
trace         ``trace_impact``                               impact trace
test_map      BESPOKE — RFC-0014 Phase B                    test-file callers of symbol
co_change     BESPOKE — RFC-0014 Phase C                    git-history co-change coupling
callers       BESPOKE — scope=point → callers_tool (R4)     point = direct callers
              BESPOKE — scope=graph → call_graph mode=callers
callees       BESPOKE — scope=point → callees_tool (R4)     point = direct callees
              BESPOKE — scope=graph → call_graph mode=callees
============  =============================================  ==========================

R4 (PRD §0 Errata): ``callers``/``callees`` are scope-discriminated.
  - ``scope=point`` (default) → ``codegraph_callers``/``codegraph_callees`` for
    direct 1-hop lookup (fast, ``function_name`` required).
  - ``scope=graph`` → ``codegraph_call_graph mode=callers|callees`` for full
    traversal (BFS, ``function_name`` required for callers/callees modes).

Both callers/callees closures read ``scope`` BEFORE the framework strips it,
and they are registered via ``register_bespoke_inner`` (G3) so project-root
rebinds propagate correctly.

R3: ``symbol`` → ``function_name`` normalization is applied automatically by
``FacadeTool._project_args`` for action_map routes, and defensively by
``FacadeTool._clean_bespoke_args`` for bespoke routes — so callers passing
``symbol=`` instead of ``function_name=`` are handled transparently.

All nav actions are read-only; a single honest ``readOnlyHint=True`` is valid
(unlike ``edit``/``project`` facades that span mutating actions).
