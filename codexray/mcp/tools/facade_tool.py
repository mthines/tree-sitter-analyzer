"""FacadeTool — the P0 geode-layer dispatcher for the 62 -> 6 consolidation.

A ``FacadeTool`` is a single MCP tool that fans an ``action`` parameter out
to one of many *inner* tools, without changing the inner tools' logic,
output, or verdict envelope. It is the foundation every Wave-B facade
(``nav`` / ``structure`` / ``search`` / ``health`` / ``edit`` / ``project``)
builds on.

Design constraints distilled from the engineering review
(``.recon/review-engineering.md``) and PRD §0 Errata:

F4 (Landmine A) — strict-param projection
    ``BaseMCPTool.__init_subclass__`` wraps every tool's ``execute`` with
    ``enforce_strict_params`` (``additionalProperties: False`` by default).
    An inner tool therefore raises ``ValueError: unknown parameter 'action'``
    if the facade forwards the merged dict verbatim. The facade MUST project
    the caller's args down to each inner tool's own ``inputSchema.properties``
    whitelist before delegating: strip facade control keys (``action`` /
    ``scope`` / ``mode`` when the inner doesn't declare them) AND drop
    sibling-action params.

F5 — bespoke routing
    Three production routes bypass ``registry[name].execute()``:
    ``analyze_code_structure`` -> ``table_format_tool``,
    ``extract_code_section`` -> ``handle_extract_code_section`` (batch
    reshaping), and ``search_content`` / ``find_and_grep`` whose
    ``execute`` returns ``dict | int`` (bare int = exit code when
    ``suppress_output=True``). These register as ``bespoke_map`` callables;
    the facade forwards the cleaned args (control keys stripped) but does
    NOT project them to an inner schema — the bespoke callable owns its own
    arg handling — and tolerates a non-dict return.

R3 — symbol / function_name normalize
    Some inner tools read ``function_name`` (callers/callees), others read
    ``symbol`` (navigate/resolve). The facade copies ``symbol`` ->
    ``function_name`` (when the target inner declares ``function_name`` and
    the caller didn't set it) BEFORE projection, else the canonical
    ``symbol`` would be stripped before it could be copied.

G3 — rebind propagation
    ``server.set_project_path`` loops ``_tools.values()`` calling
    ``set_project_path`` on each. The facade does NOT override
    ``set_project_path`` (forbidden by
    ``test_no_mcp_tool_overrides_set_project_path``); instead it forwards the
    new root to every held inner instance via the allowed
    ``_on_project_root_changed`` hook.

The facade never re-wraps the inner's response: ``verdict`` / ``agent_summary``
/ ``toon_content`` stay verbatim so the centralised envelope in
``base_tool.py`` and the MCP dispatch normaliser remain the single source of
truth.

# unaffected — it reads ``inner.get_tool_definition()``, never this public
# schema). Per-action param discovery is carried in the facade ``description``
# (description-as-discovery, à la Rhizome), not in the schema body.
#
# Descriptions are deliberately terse: per-action semantics live in the facade

    Parameters
    ----------
    facade_name:
        Public MCP tool name (e.g. ``"search"``).
    action_map:
        ``{action_name: inner_tool_instance}``. Each inner is a live
        ``BaseMCPTool`` whose ``execute`` is routed to after arg projection.
    bespoke_map:
        Optional ``{action_name: async callable}`` for F5 routes that bypass
        the registry. The callable receives the cleaned args (control keys
        stripped, R3-normalized) and owns its own arg handling. Its return
        may be a ``dict`` or a bare ``int``; the facade forwards it as-is.
    description:
        Optional facade description used in ``get_tool_definition``.
    annotations:
        Optional MCP annotations dict. A facade spanning read + mutating
        actions cannot honestly declare a single ``readOnlyHint``; callers
        pass the honest (usually non-read-only) set or omit it.
    extra_public_params:
        Optional ``{param_name: json_schema_spec}`` of facade-specific params
        surfaced on THIS facade's public inputSchema in addition to
        ``_CORE_FACADE_PARAMS`` (#640: ``kind`` worked via
        additionalProperties but was undiscoverable to schema-reading
        agents). Use sparingly — one high-value param, never a per-inner
        union (the Wave D token diet stands). Never added to ``required``.
