"""Pure depth-limited call-tree builder (the ``tree`` primitive).

Mirrors mycelium RFC-0020 (callee tree) / RFC-0021 (caller tree): instead of an
agent iterating ``codegraph_callees`` / ``codegraph_callers`` BFS-style and
accumulating state across many round-trips, build the whole depth-limited tree
in ONE call and return a nested ``{name, file, line, children}`` structure.

This module is deliberately storage-agnostic: it takes an ``expand`` callback
that returns the *direct* neighbours of a node, so the same DFS works over the
SQL edge store, the in-memory CallGraph, or an in-memory test dict. The actual
edge lookups are reused from the existing single-hop call-graph machinery
(``ASTCache.query_callees`` / ``query_callers``, which themselves delegate to
``bfs_callees`` / ``bfs_callers`` over the unified ``edges`` table — B1).

Guards (so a large Java callee tree cannot blow the token budget):

* ``max_depth`` — capped traversal depth (default 3, hard cap 10).
* ``max_nodes`` — global node cap across the whole tree; once hit, expansion
  stops and ``truncated`` is flagged.
* per-path visited set — a node already on the current DFS path is returned as
  a leaf (cycle break), matching RFC-0020/0021.
