Refactoring Suggestions MCP Tool

Analyzes files and returns concrete, actionable refactoring suggestions
with exact function names, line ranges, extraction targets, and code skeletons.

Uses tree-sitter for cross-language element extraction (all 15 languages),
with Python-AST enhanced analysis (nesting, params, static detection) as bonus.
