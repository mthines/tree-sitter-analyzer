"""Shared symbol-body inlining — coordinates -> content + deterrent (P2).

``call_path`` proved the turn-saving trade-off: inlining the *verbatim source
body* next to a symbol's coordinates eliminates the follow-up ``Read`` per
``file:line`` that an agent would otherwise issue.  An agent's real cost is
``turns x tokens-per-turn``; paying once for a (bigger) inlined response is
cheaper than N downstream Read turns.

P2 generalises that mechanism to the tools agents actually reach for first when
exploring an unfamiliar codebase:

  - ``nav navigate``  — inline the definition body (full tier).
  - ``nav callers`` / ``nav callees`` — inline each neighbour's body (neighbour
    tier, capped to the top-N neighbours so a 1000-caller fan-out can't blow up
    the response).
  - ``search symbol`` — inline a short body summary for each top match (summary
    tier) so the agent judges relevance from content, not coordinates.

Three cap tiers keep big-Java responses bounded.  Long bodies are truncated and
flagged with ``full_at`` ``file:line`` so the agent can still Read on demand.

The low-level ``_build_def_index`` / ``_resolve_def`` / ``_read_body``
primitives are reused from :mod:`call_path_enrich` so there is a single
implementation of the def-index scan and the verbatim-read-with-caps logic.
