"""One-call code graph context tool.

This tool is the graph-first answer for broad questions such as
"how does request routing work" or focused traces such as
"trace handle_request to get_user". It deliberately stays self-contained:
symbol search, call graph expansion, and source snippets are gathered in one
MCP call so agents do not burn turns chaining search, callers, callees, and
raw file reads.
