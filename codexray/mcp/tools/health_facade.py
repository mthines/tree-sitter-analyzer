"""``health`` facade — Wave B facade for the FacadeTool framework (P0 geode layer).

Folds 12 health/analysis capabilities behind one ``action`` parameter.
The ``uml`` / ``graph`` / ``similarity`` trio have been split into the
separate ``viz`` facade (see ``viz_facade.py``).

==========  ===========================================  ===================================================
action      inner / route                                engine / purpose
==========  ===========================================  ===================================================
project     ``project_health``  (ProjectHealthTool)      overall project code-quality grade
file        ``file_health``     (FileHealthTool)         per-file health metrics
scale       ``analyze_scale``   (AnalyzeScaleTool)       LOC / complexity / size metrics
patterns    ``code_patterns``   (CodePatternsTool)       anti-pattern detection by category
heatmap     ``codegraph_complexity_heatmap``             complexity ranked by file / function
imports     ``codegraph_import_graph``                   module import dependency graph
matrix      ``codegraph_dependency_matrix``              coupling matrix, coupling ranks
dead        ``codegraph_dead_code``                      unreferenced functions / imports / vars
routes      ``route_detector``  (RouteDetectorTool)      HTTP route discovery
overview    ``codegraph_overview``                       entry-points / hubs / dead summary
deps        ``analyze_dependencies`` (R5)                dependency analysis — mode sub-param:
                                                         summary|cycles|blast|file_deps
test_gap    ``codegraph_test_gap`` (CodeGraphTestGapTool) untested symbol discovery, complexity-ranked
==========  ===========================================  ===================================================

R5 (PRD §3): ``deps`` maps to the single ``DependencyAnalysisTool`` whose
``mode`` param (``summary`` / ``cycles`` / ``blast`` / ``file_deps``) is
declared in the inner schema. The framework's arg-projection filter KEEPS
``mode`` because the inner declares it — no bespoke closure needed.

Annotation honesty: every action in this facade is read-only, so
``readOnlyHint=True`` is valid (unlike the ``edit`` / ``project`` facades
that span mutating actions).
