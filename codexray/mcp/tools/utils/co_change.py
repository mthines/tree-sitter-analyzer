"""Git-history co-change coupling for the ``nav action=co_change`` facade route.

RFC-0014 Phase C: files that historically change together with X.

Algorithm: single ``git log --pretty=format:%H --name-only`` subprocess
(no ``-- <target_file>`` path-filter so we see ALL commits in the window and
collect both target-commit SHAs and per-file total commit counts in one pass).
Per-file commit-SHA sets give the true association lift:

    lift = P(A^B) / (P(A) * P(B))
         = (shared_commits * total_commits) / (target_commits * peer_commits)

where ``peer_commits`` is the peer's TOTAL commit count in the window, NOT the
shared count -- the two are different precisely when a peer changes often
without target, making it a common file (low lift).  ``total_commits`` is the
ACTUAL number of unique commit SHAs seen in the parsed log (not ``max_commits``),
so a 43-commit repo with max_commits=500 gets the true lift (RFC-0014 INFO fix).

Results are keyed by (project_root, target_file, HEAD, max_commits, min_shared,
max_results) for zero-cost repeat calls within one MCP session (LRU
maxsize=256).
