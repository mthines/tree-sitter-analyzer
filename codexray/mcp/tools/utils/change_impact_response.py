# documented footgun (see H2/H3) — every consumer that capped a

# H8 / J11: ``verdict`` values exposed by change-impact.
#
# Before J11 (round-22) the tool emitted ``CLEAN`` whenever the analysis
# ran without an invalid-scope warning, even when ``changed_count > 0``.
# That collided with the safety-tool vocabulary (safe_to_edit /
# code_patterns) where ``CLEAN`` means "no issues, ship it" — agents that
# chained the two tools shipped pending work because change-impact's
# ``CLEAN`` meant "the scope filter applied" not "no work to verify".
#
# Post J11 the verdict is content-aware:
#   * ``SAFE``    — analysis succeeded AND ``changed_count == 0`` (no
#                   pending work to verify, equivalent to the legacy
#                   ``CLEAN`` semantics).
#   * ``REVIEW``  — analysis succeeded but ``changed_count > 0``; the
#                   caller still has verification work to do before the
#                   queue is closed.
#   * ``WARN``    — soft-failure (e.g. scope paths that don't exist on
#                   disk) — analysis ran but the caller's input was
#                   partly ignored.
#
# We deliberately don't escalate to ``UNSAFE`` here because the tool
# answers a different question (impact) than the safety tools.
#
# F1 (round-37f7): ``CHANGE_IMPACT_VERDICT_CLEAN`` was previously
# ``"CLEAN"`` — a value outside the shared cross-tool legal vocabulary
# (:data:`codexray.mcp.tools.base_tool._LEGAL_VERDICTS`).
# It now maps to ``"SAFE"`` so chained agents that branch on a single
# string (Claude Code, Cursor, the queue-ledger CLI) don't have to
# special-case change_impact. The constant *name* keeps the legacy
# ``_CLEAN`` suffix for backward compatibility with call sites that
# import it by name; the *value* is what changed.

        Pre-J11 the response emitted ``CLEAN`` even with 14 changed files,
        which collided with the safety-tool vocabulary (where ``CLEAN``
        means "ship it"). Agents chaining the two ended up shipping pending
        work.
      - ``agent_summary["next_step"]`` is rewritten with a concrete
        "did you typo?" hint when any scope is invalid so the agent's
        decision loop catches it before re-running.
      - ``summary_line`` (top-level and inside ``agent_summary``) gains a
        ``scope_invalid=N`` token so chained tools can grep one line.
      - We never flip ``success`` to False. The analysis still has value;
        the verdict escalation is what tells agents "you ignored part of
        the input".
