"""Syntax-validity gate for tree-sitter-based MCP tools (M3).

Three detection tools — code_patterns, file_health, safe_to_edit — used
to grade a file containing only ``def broken(:`` as ``SAFE`` / ``A`` /
``safe``. Tree-sitter is permissive: it builds *something* for any
input, sprinkling ``ERROR`` nodes through the tree. The downstream
analysis (smells, dimensions, dependency walk) then runs against that
garbled tree and produces a clean-bill-of-health number that an agent
might happily act on — i.e. "proceed with planned change" on a file
that fails to parse.

This module gives the three tools a single, shared way to ask
"did the parser actually understand the file?" and a single canonical
shape for the short-circuit response so the three tools agree on the
signal name (``syntax_error``) and the verdict (``ERROR``).

    Tree-sitter exposes two booleans on the root node:

    * ``has_error`` — true when **any** ``ERROR`` node exists anywhere

    * ``is_error`` — true only when the root node itself is an error,
      which mostly happens for completely-empty input.

    We use ``has_error`` because syntax errors deep in the tree should
    still disable downstream analysis: a function body with a half-typed
    statement gives meaningless smell/dimension scores.

    Defensive defaults: a missing tree or root counts as "broken" so the
    caller can short-circuit safely; the calling tool already has a
    separate empty-file / non-code branch for the truly-trivial cases.
