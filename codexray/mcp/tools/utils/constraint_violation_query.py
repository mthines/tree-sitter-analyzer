"""Read-side helper for ``ast_constraint_violations``.

Both ``safe_to_edit`` and ``analyze_change_impact`` need to query the
persisted violations table without re-running the evaluator. This
module owns the SQL so the two call sites can't drift apart.

Design choices:
    * All queries are read-only and short-circuit when the cache DB
      doesn't exist — both gate tools must remain usable on fresh repos.
    * Exception swallowing is intentional: a stale or partially-migrated
      DB should NOT take down the gate tool. We log at debug and return
      an empty list; the existing risk-scoring path still produces a
      valid response.
