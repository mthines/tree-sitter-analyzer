"""Edge-stream evaluator for architectural constraints.

Given a list of loaded :class:`Constraint` rules and an open SQLite
connection holding the unified ``edges`` table, yields one
:class:`Violation` per offending CALLS edge.

Design contract:

* The callee's resolved file (``metadata.callee_resolved_file`` on the
  ``edges`` row) is preferred when present and populated, so we benefit
  from import-aware resolution. Edges where it is empty fall back to
  ``file_path`` (the caller's file). Edges with no callee location at all
  are skipped — they would generate false positives on unresolved calls.

* Performance is load-bearing: this is called on every change_impact /
  safe_to_edit invocation. We compile globs once, batch the SELECT into
  a single streaming cursor, and do O(rules) regex matches per edge.

* The function is pure: it never writes to the DB. The MCP tool layer
  owns the write-through into ``ast_constraint_violations``.

* Import-reachability guard (#780): a resolved callee file is only flagged
  as a constraint violation when the caller actually imports the callee's
  module.  Without this guard, bare-name resolutions (e.g. ``update`` or
  ``execute``) can be matched to same-named methods in forbidden modules
  even when the caller has no import relationship to those modules.  When
  ``ast_imports`` is absent (e.g. test fixtures) the guard is skipped and
  the evaluator falls back to the pre-guard behaviour.
