"""YAML loader for architectural-constraints.yml.

Public surface:
    load_constraints(project_root) -> list[Constraint]
    match_glob(pattern, path) -> bool
    ConstraintParseError

The loader is deliberately strict about top-level keys (unknown ones are
fatal — silently dropping them would mean a misspelled wrapper key ships
to prod with zero enforced rules) but lenient about per-rule keys
(unknown ones are warn-and-skip — this is the forward-compat seam for
rolling out new rule types ahead of analyzer upgrades).

Glob semantics: ``**`` matches any number of path components including
zero, but ``/`` is significant. ``mcp/**`` matches ``mcp/a/b.py`` but
NOT ``cli/mcp_helpers.py``. This is the same rule fnmatch's recursive
shell-glob model implies; ``fnmatch.translate`` gets it right.
